Customer Segmentation in Real Marketing with K-Means

Ever wondered why some customers spend a fortune while others barely engage? In marketing, understanding your customers is gold—and data science can help.

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a real business dataset, not just a classic dataset like Iris. By clustering customers based on demographics and spending behavior, marketing teams can target campaigns more effectively.

📌 Business Problem

A retail company aims to:

Increase sales without annoying customers

Reward loyal buyers

Understand which customers respond best to campaigns

Goal: Segment customers in a way that marketing teams can target effectively.

🛠️ Project Overview

Data preprocessing (encoding gender, selecting relevant features)

Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method

Clustering customers with K-Means

Creating a summary table with cluster averages and customer counts

Assigning business-friendly labels to clusters (e.g., "Premium High-Spender")

Visualizing insights with scatter plots

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

Gender (Male/Female) – Customer gender

Age – Customer age

Annual Income – Yearly income in k$

Spending Score (1–100) – Customer purchasing behavior and engagement

📈 Insights

High-income, low-spender clusters are perfect targets for upsell campaigns

Young high-spenders are ideal for loyalty programs

Moderate spenders can be re-engaged with tailored promotions

💡 Key Takeaway

Customer segmentation with K-Means is not just about numbers—it’s about turning data into actionable business strategy. Every campaign, promotion, or loyalty program can now be precision-targeted, increasing ROI and customer satisfaction. Real data science, real impact.
